      <h6>
        Wave-particle duality is exploited in many devices, such as charge-coupled devices (used in digital cameras) or in the electron microscopy of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the transmission electron microscope (TEM).
      </h6>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6>
        Quantum theory takes the wave property to be the fundamental property of all particles. A particle is seen as a moving wave packet. The wave nature of particles imposes a limitation on the simultaneous measurement of the particle’s position
        and momentum.

      <h6>
        Heisenberge’s uncertainty principle sets the limits on precision in such simultaneous measurements. An electromagnetic bomb or E-bomb is a weapon designed to incapacitate electronics with an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which can couple with
        electrical/electronic systems to engender damaging current and voltage surges.

    <h3>
      Analysing universe
    </h3>
    <h5 style="color:grey;"> Offered by Rutgers state university </h5>
    <li>

      In this course, I am using publicly available data from NASA of actual satellite observations of astronomical x-ray sources. Through this data, I learn how to explore a mysterious object of the universe as well as study unusual phenomena of the
      cosmos, objects like neutron stars, black holes, quasars, supernovae and supernova explosion gamma-ray bust, x-ray beam, etc.
      I analysed energy spectra and time series data to understand how these mysterious objects behave or works.
      I utilized an imaging (image processing ) tool called DS9 to explore the incredible diversity of astronomical observations that have made x-ray astronomy one of the most exciting fields for students.

    <h3>
      Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity
    </h3>
    <h5 style="color:grey;"> Offered by Stanford university </h5>
    <li>
      In this course, I learned about "understand einstein," especially focusing on the special theory of relativity. I focused and learned to go beyond the myth-making and the popularized presentations of relativity to gain a deeper understanding of
      Einstein, the person, and his theory's concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes. I know the more profound answer to some questions likes: How did Einstein develop his ideas? What's "special" about the special theory of relativity? Why did
      the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the "fourth dimension"? Can time run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel
      possible, and if so, how? Why can't things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the centre of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly
      speculation?

    <h3> IBM Data Science Professional Certificate </h3>
    <h5 style="color:grey;"> Offered by IBM </h5>
    <li>
      This course helps me a lot to learn about what data science is. It helps me to handle larger data sets and is accessible to analyse extensive data. Represent this data into a more straightforward format that allows other people to understand
      and is accessible to analyse for everyone. I also learned how programming languages help me to order such data sets into easy form. I know about :
      What are the challenges to handle data, and how crucial data is for everyone, especially for a physicist?
